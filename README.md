</p>

Over 5,000 SAS customers, users, and executives gather year after year to learn and exchange leading practices to advance their organization’s objectives using data, analytics and SAS® Software.  This premier event attracts members of the SAS community from more than 50 countries who attend to meet, network, and learn from peers and subject matter experts from the user community.  Volunteers from all around the world donate their time, to help organize, manage, contribute, and evaluate the content to ensure attendees have the best experience possible.

Each year there are a number of different opportunities for you to get involved with SAS Global Forum. This repository contains a folder, per year, with documents describing each of the ways you can get involved. If you're interested in doing one or more of the roles, in the README file for each year, you'll find how to register your interest.
